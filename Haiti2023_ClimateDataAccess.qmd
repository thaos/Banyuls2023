## Getting up

- Turn off alarm
- Get out of bed

## Going to sleep

- Get in bed
- Count sheep

## Disclaimers

Nothing new, everything I present is based on online material.

Brief and non exhaustive summary of tools I used to access climate data

## CMIP (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project)

Better understand past, present and future climate changes arising from natural, unforced variability or in response to changes in radiative forcing in a multi-model context. 

CMIP is a periodically conducted model intercomparison project to evaluate and compare climate models. CMIP protocols define central basic experiments which build the basis for model evaluation. 


An important goal of CMIP is to make the multi-model output publically available in a standardized format.

## CORDEX

The CORDEX vision is to advance and coordinate the science and application of regional climate downscaling through global partnerships.

Global Climate Models (GCM) can provide us with projections of how the climate of the earth may change in the future. These results are the main motivation for the international community to take decisions on climate change mitigation. However, the impacts of a changing climate, and the adaptation strategies required to deal with them, will occur on more regional and national scales. This is where Regional Climate Downscaling (RCD) has an important role to play by providing projections with much greater detail and more accurate representation of localised extreme events.

## CORDEX Goals

1. To better understand relevant regional/local climate phenomena, their variability and changes, through downscaling.
2. To evaluate and improve regional climate downscaling models and techniques
3. To produce coordinated sets of regional downscaled projections worldwide
9. To foster communication and knowledge exchange with users of regional climate information

## ESGF (Earth System Grid Federation )

 Missions	
  
• Support Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)
activities and prepare for future assessments. CMIP is
an initiative of the World Climate Research Programme.
• Develop data and metadata facilities for inclusion of
observations and reanalysis products for CMIP use.
• Enhance and improve current Earth system science
research infrastructure capabilities through involvement
of the software development community and through
adherence to sound software principles.
• Foster collaboration across agency and political.
• Integrate and interoperate with other software designed
to meet ESGF objectives such as those developed by
NASA, NOAA, and the European ENES.
• Create software infrastructure and tools that facilitate
scientific advancements.

## NetCDF 

NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries and self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. NetCDF is commonly used to store and distribute scientific data. The NetCDF software was developed at the Unidata Program Center in Boulder, Colorado, USA (Unidata NetCDF Factsheet; Also see Wikipedia article). NetCDF files usually have the extension .nc.

## NetCDF 
Data in netCDF format is self-Describing. A netCDF file includes
information about the data it contains.

CF (Climate and Fore-
cast) Conventions: designed to promote the
processing and sharing of files created with
the NetCDF API.     The conventions define
metadata that provide a definitive description
of what the data in each variable represents, and
the spatial and temporal properties of the data.
This enables users of data from different sources
to decide which quantities are comparable, and
facilitates building applications with powerful
extraction, regridding, and display capabilities.

## NetCDF examples

- see netcdf metadata and data with ncdump

- quick visualization with ncview

- load netcdf data in python with xarray

- load netcdf data in R with ncdf4


- other tools: NCO, CDO for ncdf manipulation

## CDS API: récupérer beaucoup de données
Limits

Limits (per-user, global and system) are set on usage of CDS resources to ensure an appropriate level of performance.

The 'live' status of the limits values can be checked here https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/live/limits

Moreover, CDS data requests also have limits in terms of number of fields and volume size which are different for each dataset

:::

## CDS API: récupérer beaucoup de données

- Submit small requests over very large and heavy requests. This will ensure your requests are not penalised in the CDS request queue. In particular, 1 variable, 1 level, 1 month pper request for ERA5 

- Loop over time period in Python
